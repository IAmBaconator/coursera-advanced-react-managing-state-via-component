# Overview
This project is a small React demo that showcases how to manage and update component state using the useState hook. The app simulates a Gift Card page for the Little Lemon Restaurant, where user interactions dynamically update the displayed state.

The project originated as a class lab and has been refactored into a portfolio-ready demo emphasizing clarity, best practices, and reusability.

# Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Local state management using React Hooks (useState)
- Updating nested state stored in objects
- Immutable state updates
- Handling user interaction events

# Lab Notes
- This project was adapted from a guided class lab.
- The initial starter app renders successfully without modification.
- The primary focus of the exercise was updating object-based state in response to user actions.
- Styling and layout were intentionally kept minimal to emphasize logic and state flow.
This project serves as a learning snapshot and a foundation for future enhancements.

# Possible Enhancements
- Convert state management to React Context for shared/global state
- Add input validation and edge-case handling
- Improve UI/UX with animations or design refinements
- Add unit tests for state transitions
- Refactor into reusable components

# Why This Project Exists
This repository is part of a growing collection of focused demos used to document my progress as a React developer and to provide clear, isolated examples of specific concepts.
